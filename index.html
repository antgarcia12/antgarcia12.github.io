	<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
	<p>Making music has always been something I’ve enjoyed. I enjoy listening to music, but sometimes when I’m listening to music, I have thoughts of how I would have done something different. For example, maybe with a hip-hop song, I would think to myself that I would have used a different kick drum or different snare. Sometimes I listen to the mix of a song and tell myself that that an instrument is too loud or even to low in the song. I eventually got introduced to the world of producing. Starting out in college, I had enough money saved to buy my equipment to pursue producing. Since then, I have enjoyed all the ways and sounds I can make. I can choose any direction I want to take a song. It’s the thrill of trying to get to my final product I enjoy the most. I think of it as like constructing a brand-new skyscraper. Layer by layer, piece by piece, I see my project getting bigger and my idea coming more to life. Granted, there are the people who will think differently of what I create, but in the end, as long as I’m satisfied with my product, I’m happy.</p>

	<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
	<p>Hello my name is Anthony. I make websites that will help local businesses and help strengthen the economy here back in Albuquerque. I'm doing this by learning how to code professionally at Deep Dive Coding's Fullstack Bootcamp they offer here at CNM Ingenuity. How can you help our economy here in Albuquerque?</p>
	<h2>Visuals Speak</h2>
	<img src="./window-giraffe.jpg" height="300" width="400">
	<p>The black and white window shows how my life is right now, black and white, with not much color in my life. The window also represents myself reflecting on my life and trying to look out for opportunities I can take to make my life better. The picture of the giraffe represents 3 years from now, looking over the horizon, as I am able to do what I want with my career. I stand tall to challenges and I see what is ahead of me, which makes me more excited.</p>
	<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
	<h4>Week 1</h4>
	<p>The first week of the bootcamp has been challenging to say the least. When I say challenging, I don't mean in terms of difficulty but more of a life style change. Before the class, I was trying my best to balance my job and school, so just to have the opportunity to focus on just school is a blessing. As each day was passing I realized that the material we learn is something that must be practiced everyday. Practice looks like one of the main keys to passing this bootcamp. I'm sure i'll find other ways of passing. I really can't wait for what's to come and how good I get at coding.</p>
